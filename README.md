Considering how big of a dumpster fire 2020 was, we were interested in seeing whether Mother Nature followed suit and really showed us that she hated us. To do this, weâ€™re examining storm data for the year 2020 for all United States including Washington D.C., Puerto Rico, and other regions/territories. This dataset includes more than 40,000 lines of data which includes key data points for each storm recorded in 2020 by state, with accompanying details such as damage done, magnitude, etc.

Our goal was to create an interactive dashboard allowing the user to select one of the US States in a dropdown. Doing so will render 3 (maybe 4) charts showing key visualizations for that state. Tools we will be using include pandas, Javascript, d3, and plotly.
